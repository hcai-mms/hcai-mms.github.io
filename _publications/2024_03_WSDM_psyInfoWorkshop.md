abstract: "The Psychology-informed Information Access Systems (PsyIAS) workshop bridges the fields of machine learning and psychology, aiming to connect the research communities of information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing, as well as cognitive and behavioral psychology. It serves as a forum for multidisciplinary discussions about the use of psychological constructs, theories, and empirical findings for modeling and predicting user preferences, intents, and behaviors. PsyIAS particularly focuses on research that incorporates such psychology-inspired models into the search, retrieval, and recommendation processes, creates corresponding algorithms and systems, or looks into the role of cognitive processes underlying human information access. More information can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/psyias." # insert the abstract of your publication between the quotes; you can use html e.g. to make links (<a></a>) or generate bold (<b></b>) etc. text
