abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for a variety of tasks such as text generation, ranking, and decision-making. However, their outputs can be influenced by various forms of biases. One such bias is positional bias, where models prioritize items based on their position within a given prompt rather than their content or quality, impacting on how LLMs interpret and weigh information, potentially compromising fairness, reliability, and robustness. To assess positional bias, we prompt a range of LLMs to generate descriptions for a list of topics, systematically permuting their order and analyzing variations in the responses. Our analysis shows that ranking position affects structural features and coherence, with some LLMs also reordering or omitting topics. Nonetheless, the impact of positional bias varies across different LLMs and topics, indicating an interplay with other related biases." # insert the abstract of your publication between the quotes; you can use html e.g. to make links (<a></a>) or generate bold (<b></b>) etc. text
