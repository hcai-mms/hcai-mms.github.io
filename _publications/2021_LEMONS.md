abstract: "Although current music recommender systems suggest new tracks to their users, they do not provide listenable explanations of why a user should listen to them. LEMONS (Demonstration video: https://youtu.be/giSPrPnZ7mc) is a new system that addresses this gap by (1) adopting a deep learning approach to generate audio content-based recommendations from the audio tracks and (2) providing listenable explanations based on the time-source segmentation of the recommended tracks using the recently proposed audioLIME." # insert the abstract of your publication between the quotes; you can use html e.g. to make links (<a></a>) or generate bold (<b></b>) etc. text
